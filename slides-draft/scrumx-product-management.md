# Product Management

---

## The Product

------

### Product Definition

As a **Scrum Master**

I want to help coach my team on

**modern software engineering practices**

So that my team is able to improve its **technical excellence**

------

### The Product

For Scrum Masters
who want to coach their teams on technical excellence
the Scrum X solution
is a project-based learning offering
that provides you knowledge and confidence to coach modern SE practices,
unlike other ways to learn
our solution is hands-on and provides you with your own coaching toolkit

------

### Problem To Solve

Being able (as a SM) to coach my team

---

## Setup in ProductBoard

------

### Products

1. Customer Value - the primary product for Scrum Masters
1. Enablers - what is needed to enable the above
1. Value Stream - covering the life cycle of customers
1. Ideas - collect feedback and validate before build

------

### Hierarchy (Customer Value)

* Product = ScrumX
* Component = Technical excellence topic
* Sub-component = Learning method
* Feature = Implementation

------

### Hierarchy (Enablers: Platform)

* Product = ScrumX - Enablers (Platform)
* Component = Repo / Component Service
* Feature = Implementation

------

### Hierarchy (Value Stream)

* Product = ScrumX - Ideas
* Component = Phase (i.e. Adoption - Onboarding)
* Feature = Implementation

------

### Hierarchy (Ideas)

* Product = ScruMX - Enablers (Platform)
* Feature = Hypothesis to validate

------

### Hierarchy (Customer Value)

* Product = Scrum X
* Component = Technical excellence topic
* Sub-component = Learning method
* Feature = Implementation

------

Frames a user's needs as a job that the user want to get done

------

### Functional Aspects

* Coach my team on technical excellence

------

### Personal Aspects

* Feel confident coaching on technical excellence
* Better qualified as well-rounded SM

------

### Social Aspects

* Status of being a SM who understands Engineers

------

Jobs that customers want to accomplish in conjunction with the main jobs-to-be-done.

------

#### Retrospectives

* Functional: Cover technical excellence in retro's
* Personal: Improvements driven by your coaching
* Social: Retro's more valued by team

------

## Aligned with Impact Mapping

------

![Impact Mapping Example](https://www.impactmapping.org/assets/im_template.png)

------

* Goal: Be able to coach my team on technical excellence
* Actor: Scrum Master
* Impact: Technical excellence topic
* Deliverable: Learning method

------

### Example

* Goal: Coach teams on technical excellence
* Actor: Scrum Master
* Impact: Learn by doing (hands on labs)
* Deliverable: Lab on trunk-based development
* Story: Push commit to trunk
* Story: Compare to PR on branch
* Story: Example of merge hell

------

### Sense Check

If we have Scrum Masters try hands on labs, comparing direct merge to trunk versus the more common practice of creating branches and using pull requests to merge to trunk, including experiencing merge hell scenario, they will better appreciate the value of trunk-based development and understand first hand why the alternative has more "wastes" (Lean), and will feel inspired to encourage their teams to consider adopting it.

## Aligned with SAFe

------

### Value Streams

Value streams represent the service of steps that an organization uses to implement **solutions** that provide a continuous flow of value to **a customer**.

------

### Solution

Each value stream produces one or more solutions, which are **products, services, or systems** delivered to the customer, whether **internal** or **external** to the enterprise.

------

### Three levels of backlog

1. Portfolio Backlog - Epics scoped across solutions / customers
2. Solution Backlog - Capabilities scoped across ARTs
3. Program Backlog - Features scoped for a single ART

All levels can include "enabler" type epics/capabilities/features

------

### "Product" Aligned Definition

* SAFe defines solutions and value streams based on **customer**
* "Solution" definition aligns with LeSS definition of **product**
* "Solution backlog" equates to LeSS single **product backlog**

------

### Solution Backlog

Upcoming **capabilities and enablers**, each of which can span multiple ARTs and is intended to advance the solution **("product")** and build its architectural runway.

------

### Lean Portfolio Management

* Portfolio is a macro level view across the all solutions / customers
* LPM governs work at this macro level
* There is a Kanban defined flow for this portfolio level
* Thus not really relevant for Scrum X
