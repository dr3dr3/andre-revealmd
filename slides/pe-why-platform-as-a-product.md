# Why

## Platform-as-a-Product

---

## Product Teams

------

* Long-running + long-term thinking
* Look after what they have built
* Build up deep expertise in a domain
* Apply product management practices
* Focus on customer value and experience

------

### Product over Project

> "Software projects are a popular way of funding and organizing software development. They organize work into temporary, build-only teams and are funded with specific benefits projected in a business case. Product-mode instead uses durable, ideate-build-run teams working on a persistent business issue. Product-mode allows teams to reorient quickly, reduces their end-to-end cycle time, and allows validation of actual benefits by using short-cycle iterations while maintaining the architectural integrity of their software to preserve their long-term effectiveness."

---

## Customer Driven

------

* A role focused on understanding the customer
* Typically Product Owners and/or Product Managers
* Continuous discovery of what value to provide
* Also considers the CX (i.e. onboarding, usage)
* "Outside In" rather than "Inside Out"

## Platform Engineering

------

> "Platform engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal developer platforms to improve developer experience and scale agile and **DevOps practices**"
> [🔗 Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5519995)

------

> "Platform engineering is a practice built up from **DevOps principles** that seeks to improve each development team’s security, compliance, costs, and time-to-business value through improved developer experiences and self-service within a secure, governed framework. It's both **product-based mindset shift** and a set of tools and systems to support it."
> [🔗 Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/platform-engineering/what-is-platform-engineering)

------

> "Platform engineering is a new discipline that emerged in response to the growing complexity of modern cloud-native architectures. It describes the practice of building and maintaining an integrated product, called an **Internal Developer Platform**, which acts as a flexible and supported abstraction layer between developers and the underlying technologies of their applications."
> [🔗 Humanitec](https://humanitec.com/platform-engineering)

------

> "Platform engineering is trending because of its promise to optimize the developer experience and accelerate product teams’ delivery of customer value.” They predict  that, by 2026, 80 percent of software engineering organizations will have platform teams building Internal Developer Platforms."
> [🔗 Gartner](https://humanitec.com/blog/gartner-internal-developer-platforms-platform-engineering)

---

## Platform as a Product

------

> "For platform engineering to be successful, organizations must adopt the **"platform-as-a-product" mindset**. Adopting a product-oriented mindset enables platform teams to address challenges in the engineering pipeline effectively. Establishing direct communication channels between engineers and the IDP is imperative for successful platform engineering and can serve as a crucial determinant of its success."
> [🔗 Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/04/18/understanding-what-platform-engineering-is-and-is-not/)

------

> "Successful platform teams treat their IDP like any other product. This approach ensures that a platform team builds an IDP developers **actually want to use** and that can deliver value to the organization."
> [🔗 Team Topologies](https://humanitec.com/blog/platform-as-a-product-the-evolution-of-devops-and-platform-engineering)

------

> "Many of the disappointments that organizations experience with platforms stem from the failure to treat them as products. For example, many platforms intended for developer infrastructure lack the initial research into user needs and contextual analysis we’ve come to expect in other types of products. This leads to **problems with user experience and adoption**, and can ultimately even drive developers to take their sought-after skills elsewhere."

### Summary

* The customers are the internal Engineers
* The product is the platform for their use
* Goal is to provide value to them
* So they are able to better deliver value in their teams
* Plus improving the daily work experience of Engineers

------

## What is the Product?

------

* CI/CD Pipelines
* Imposter Service
* Golden paths / paved paths
* Testing Services
* Security checks

Driven by what provides most value for the community in Engineers

------

### Value for Engineers

* Improves the developer experience (DevEx)
* Eliminate each team building platform elements (e.g. pipelines)
* Reduces "cognitive load" / Engineers can focus on creating value
* Consistency in how things are done, balanced with teams needs
* Help teams improve engineering practices (e.g. DevOps)

------

### The platform...

* is self-service for the overwhelming majority of use cases.
* is composable, discrete services that can be used independently.
* does not force an inflexible way of working on the delivery team.
* is quick to start using, with an easy on-ramp
* has a rich internal user community for sharing.
* is secure and compliant by default.
* is maintained and always up to date.

## Actions

------

### Focus on common problems

> "Platform teams prevent other teams within from reinventing the wheel by tackling shared problems over and over. It’s key to figure out what these common issues are: start by understanding developer pain points and friction areas that cause slowdowns in development."
